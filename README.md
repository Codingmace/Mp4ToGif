# Mp4ToGif
The goal of the program is to compress MP4 files. 
1. It creates images at certain points (User defined)
2. Puts the images together into a GIF (May be bigger than original MP4)
3. (Optional) Turns the GIF into MP4 for less space (Test file does 14 MB to 4 MB)
4. (Optional) Cleans up all the files.
# WARNINGS
- This is not a professional format as I was writting it quickly. Didn't add an __init__ because I am a Java programmer by heart.
# Improvements
- Create input and output folder targets
- Add a GUI (Python sucks so not going to happen)
- Being able to do the folder option
- Creating a preview beforehand
- Simplifying the modules as there are so many
- Making the software smaller.
